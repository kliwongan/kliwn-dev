## Software developer, builder, hardware and homelab enthusiast

Hello! I'm a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo with a BMath in Computational Mathematics. I've worked at startups like Milk Moovement and eSentire, making products that are still used by people today.

Some of the personal projects I've made/worked on are:
- Building a raceable car out of e-waste for a hackathon, with no mechanical hardware experience
- [Robyn](https://github.com/sparckles/Robyn), a web server library with a Rust backend exposed to Python with bindings. I worked on prototyping a request schema validation feature.
- [Daft](https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft), a "high-performance data engine for AI and multimodal workloads". So far I've only added a power function on the data processing engine, but I'm going to be doing more in the future.
- mykv, my own from-scratch implementation of a distributed key value store using the Raft algorithm, written in Rust. In progress.
- My homelab, which currently only consists of a single Proxmox node which I built myself and connected to a Sipeed KVM unit, for full remote access.
- Many others that I will have to dig up from the unfinished project graveyard and Frankenstein into a working MVP
